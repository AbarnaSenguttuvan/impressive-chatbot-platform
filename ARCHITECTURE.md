# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview
Full-stack chatbot platform demonstrating modern web development practices and scalable architecture.

## System Architecture
- **Client-Server Model** with clear separation of concerns
- **React Frontend** with component-based architecture
- **Node.js Backend** with Express.js framework
- **MongoDB Database** with Mongoose ODM

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Layer
- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- React Router for navigation

### Backend Layer
- Node.js runtime environment
- Express.js web application framework
- JWT for secure authentication
- MongoDB for data persistence

### Development Tools
- Git for version control
- npm for package management
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript features

## Database Design

### Collections
- **Users** - Authentication and user profiles
- **Projects** - Chatbot projects and settings
- **ChatSessions** - Conversation history

### Relationships
- One-to-many relationship between Users and Projects
- One-to-many relationship between Projects and ChatSessions

## API Architecture

### RESTful Design
- Resource-based URL structure
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent error handling
- Proper status codes

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/login
2. JWT token generated
3. Token included in subsequent requests
4. Middleware validates tokens

## Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration

## Scalability Considerations
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance
- Environment-based configuration
- Database indexing for performance
- Error logging and monitoring

## Deployment Architecture
- Frontend deployed to CDN (Netlify/Vercel)
- Backend deployed to cloud platform (Render/Railway)
- Database hosted on MongoDB Atlas
- Environment variables for configuration

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
- Real-time features with WebSockets
- Advanced AI model integrations
- Team collaboration features
- Mobile application development

## Conclusion
This architecture demonstrates understanding of modern full-stack development practices, scalable design patterns, and production-ready implementation.
